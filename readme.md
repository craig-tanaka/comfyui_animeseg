# ComfyUI Anime Segmentation Node

This is a custom node for [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) that provides anime image segmentation using the ONNX model from the [anime-segmentation](https://github.com/SkyTNT/anime-segmentation) project by SkyTNT.

The node implementation was built based on the gist [SimpleAnimeSeg.py](https://gist.github.com/city96/SimpleAnimeSeg.py) by GitHub user **city96**, adapting and packaging the model for easy use within ComfyUI.

## Features

- Segments anime-style images to extract character masks.  
- Uses the ONNX model file `isnetis.onnx` from SkyTNTâ€™s anime-segmentation repo for efficient CPU inference.  
- Simple integration as a ComfyUI custom node.  
- Designed as a foundation for anime character editing, segmentation, and more.
